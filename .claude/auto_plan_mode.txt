# Auto Plan Mode Configuration

## Planning Phase
When asked to implement features or make changes:
1. ALWAYS create a detailed plan before coding
2. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
3. Identify potential risks and dependencies
4. Get user approval before proceeding

## Implementation Phase
- Make incremental changes
- Test after each step
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Stop and re-plan if blocked

## Safety Measures
- Never make breaking changes without approval
- Always backup before major refactoring
- Use feature flags for experimental code
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Smart Contract Specific
- Always run `forge test` after contract changes
- Use `forge snapshot` to monitor gas usage
- Deploy to testnet before mainnet
- Verify contract security before deployment

## Frontend Specific
- Test UI changes in development mode
- Ensure responsive design works
- Validate Web3 integrations
- Check Cloudflare Pages compatibility
